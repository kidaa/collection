  "description": "Kia with four spread legs, inscribed. The decor of the body, S-shaped in profile, displays the usual elements of a bodied t'ao-t'ieh flanked by vertical dragons and, in the neck belt, beaked dragons with a band of rising blades filled with disolved cicada figures. The flanges on the body are low, narrow and unscored. Scores appear, instead, on the horns of the large t'ao-t'ieh and on parts of the antithetical beaked dragons appearing in a complicated arrangement on the outer surfaces of the legs. On the top of the handle is a t'ao-t'ieh with C-shaped horns, its mouth gaping over a finely-drawn cicada. The uprights, square at the base, with an incurving profile, are decorated with a spiral band, slender rising blades, and t'ao-t'ieh masks on the tops. Patina grey-green",

  "text": "Ritual bronze vessels had political and religious significance for the Shang people. More importantly, ancestors were ritually worshipped because it was believed their spirit held the power to influence the lives of their descendants. This beautiful  vessel would have held wine during the solemn ritual ceremonies that typified aristocratic Shang society. \r\n\r\nThe principal motif of nearly all Shang bronzes, and to which all other decor was subsidiary, was a type of full-face animal mask called the <I>taotie<I>. Though difficult to detect, this sacred image is encountered in the largest panel on each side of this exquisite <I>fangjia<I>, which features an overall graphic decor. The accompanying ornament also depicts stylized animals, as is typical of much Shang art. Distinguished by its square profile, this is among the rarest ritual vessels of the Bronze Age.",
