  "description": "Wine vessel; bronze with gold, silver, and copper inlay. This vessel, variously called Hu, Lei, and Min is closely related to the Ting inlaid with silver, Karlgren Number 47 (50.46.76), and may possibly be part of the same set. The decor of the several belts is largely based on single and double volutes and volutes with triangles. These typical elements of the Huai decor must, to a degree, be extremely corrupted and geometricized derivatives of zoomorphic motifs (dragons and birds). The moveable ring handles, with an inlaid pattern, are fixed in the mouths of silver t'ao-t'ieh masks applied to the shoulder. The inlay in this decor belt includes gold as well as silver; the remainder is in silver only. This wine vessel is one of the most splendid examples of Late Chou bronze art and the inlay technique. Patina dark brown with green patches.",

  "text": "This exquisitely crafted vessel ranks amongst the world's finest examples of late Zhou dynasty inlaid bronzes. As religious beliefs changed, ritual bronzes became less sacred and more profane in use and decoration. By the late Zhou period, a secularization of bronze ornament had occurred. The sacred masks and symbolic animal motifs of Shang and Western Zhou were increasingly replaced with abstract surface ornament such as \"hook and comma\" patterns, granulation or, as in this case, metallic inlay. This splendid geometric, brocade-like pattern of gold and silver inlay was done to delight the eye rather than inspire religious reverence.",
