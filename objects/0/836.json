The socket is fitted with a tawny-white jade blade mottled with warm brown and flecks of brilliant green. The edges of the pointed blade are finished with bevels that narrow toward the point. A central ridge run from socket to point. A closed crack, dark brown at the lower end, runs diagonally from the socket to the mid-section of the pointed end. Patina green",
