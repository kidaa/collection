  "description": "The design of highly stylized dragons, inlaid with silver, appears on the two main areas of this butt cap. The encircling rounded band carries the volute and angle pattern poplular in Huai time. Like 50.46.5, this cap is oval in cross-section. Butt caps of this type, designed for lance hafts, are quite rare. Patina reddish-brown with small areas of green. Bronze with silver inlay.",
