  "text": "All of these bronze finials would have been socketed to a pole of the same type that was most likely used on a chariot. The stylized animals with their decorative flanges and C-shaped horns relate in general to the standard decor of Shang dynasty ritual vessels. One of the birds is cast with a pellet in the body thus causing it to rattle when moved. What certain animals meant to the ancient Chinese remains speculative, but they all seem to have held protective and auspicious power.",
