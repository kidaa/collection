  "description": "Several aspects of this vessel set it apart from others of the Kuei type in the collection. Most immediately arresting is the high, square base on which it rests. Other differences are the spiral ground of the decor, the absence of a neck belt, the division of the vessel into four vertical panels by four flanges in the foot belt by two flanges and the two handles on the belly. Atypical Early Chou feature distinguishes the heavy, thick flanges the breaking through of the T-scores to give the impression of big hooks. The flanges on the body form the center lines of the familiar bodied t'ao-t'ieh. In the foot belt just below, the flanges are the median lines of rudimentary t'oa-t'ieh masks (nose and forehead shield) flanked by trunked dragons of the winged variety which are hee drawn so far apart as to isolate and emphasize the t'ao-t'ieh shield. The t'ao-t'ieh on the base is the same as the one on the belly except for the central line, here a slight ridge instead of a flange. The handle is the most remarkable feature of the vessel. The bow displays the wings of a bird in relief, and the projection at the bottom contains the curved-up bird's tail and its feet descending almost to rest on the tail. The head of the bird body is that of an elephant with big ears in pointed C-shape, raised trunk and protruding tusks. Patina green",

  "text": "During the Western Zhou dynasty, ancestors were revered and worshipped for their power to influence the lives of their descendants. To this end, numerous bronze vessels of various shapes were cast as sacrificial containers for offerings of food and wine to the spirits. The socle, or pedestal, of this gui, as well as the bowl itself display protective taotie masks in high relief. The vessel is distinguished by its handles which combine a crested elephant head with a bird body. \r\n(ancestral spirits)",
