  "description": "This example, on a high, cylindrical base, is closely related to 50.46.24. Here, however the scored flanges extend to the back of the head and the front of the neck instead of being confined to the back. The S-shaped horns are reminiscent of those seen on many t'ao-t'ieh, e.g. Karlgren Number 31 (50.46.104). Patina grey-green.",
