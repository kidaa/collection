  "description": "Wine Can, HU (YU)?, inscribed. This vessel type, tall with round cross section, is customarily called 'YU' if it has a handle, 'HU' if it has not. The decor is limited and discreet. The foot belt carries an eyed band with diagonals. The belts on neck and lid, bordered by circle bands, display the animal triple band a highly dissolved bodied t'ao-t'ieh with a row of quills on its back. The flange marking the center line of the face has been reduced to a narrow ridge.The dome-shaped lid has a ring knob and no collar. The handle, adorned with rams' heads at the ends, displays the same kind of cramped t'ao-t'ieh as that on the 'Yu' 50.46.94 - Karlgren plate 21. Patina grey-green.",
