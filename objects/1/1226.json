  "text": "Goya was the court painter for two kings of Spain, but his fame as a portrait artist wasn't limited to royalty. In 1819, Goya was seriously ill and his doctor, Eugenio Arrieta, nursed him back to health. He later presented Arrieta with this painting, the last of his many self-portraits. The inscription at the bottom reads, \"Goya gives thanks to his friend Arrieta for the expert care with which he saved his life from an acute and dangerous illness that he suffered at the close of the year 1819 when he was 73 years old. He painted it in 1820.\" This inscription gives the canvas the appearance of an ex-voto, a type of religious painting that expresses gratitude for deliverance from calamity.",
