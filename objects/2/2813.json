  "text": "The decoration of this ceremonial tripod consists of a continuous graphic pattern of interlaced bands in five separate registers. The frieze under the rim displays abstract bands which, in turn, are filled with a \"meander-like\" pattern. This basic decorative vocabulary, although not uncommon in late Zhou bronzes, has yet to be associated with a specific archaeological site. It can, however, be considered a precursor to the more fully developed intertwine motif commonly defined as the \"Liyu style.\" The term Liyu style is, however, misleading as that category of sixth to early fifth century decoration is more accurately associated with the ancient foundry site of Houma in Shanxi province.",
