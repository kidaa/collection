  "text": "These two mirror-image plaques cast in shallow relief show a feline and an eagle with griffin head locked in combat. Animal combat and hunting themes were popular with the nomadic peoples of China's northern frontier during the late Bronze Age. Numerous bronze horse trappings, weapons, belt hooks and plaques such as these have been excavated from tombs in Mongolia, Siberia, the Ordos region and northern provinces of China. This so-called \"animal style\" influenced the art of the more settled populations of China during the late Bronze Age. The animals and hunting scenes in the ritual hu shown above for instance, originated in the animal style art of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes.",
