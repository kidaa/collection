  "text": "This gilt bronze belt hook was reportedly discovered at Jincun, the important Warring States (480-221 BCE) site in Henan province famous for the inlaid bronzes found there. The bronze body has been inset with six jade plaques, five of which are carved in shallow relief with matching scroll motifs suggesting entwined animals and stylized <I>taotie<I> masks. Dragon heads emerge at either end, with a plain shield-shaped plaque (likely a replacement) set over the dragon head on the butt end. The combination of precious materials here is quite luxurious. Jades had been worn as personal ornaments throughout most of the Bronze Age, and it seems natural that they would be combined with bronze and gold to create utilitarian but exceedingly sumptuous items of personal dress.",
